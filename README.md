# 🍽️ MealMath (MVP)

MealMath is a recipe-scaling calculator that helps users accurately adjust ingredient quantities based on the number of servings they want to cook for.

The project began as a **command-line MVP**, focusing on core calculation logic, unit conversions, and input validation. It is actively being developed into a full web application.

---

## ✨ Features

- Scale recipes up or down based on target servings
- Automatic ingredient quantity recalculation
- Basic unit conversion support (`cups`, `tbsp`, `tsp`)
- Input validation with clear error messages
- Command-line interface (CLI) usage
- Designed with future UI and database integration in mind

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The program performs the following steps:

1. Calculates a scaling factor using  
   `targetServings / originalServings`
2. Applies the factor to each ingredient
3. Optionally converts units if a compatible target unit is provided
4. Rounds quantities to two decimal places for readability

All logic is isolated into pure functions to allow easy reuse in future versions (web UI, API, database).

## ▶️ Usage

### Run the program:

```node index.js <servings> [unit]```

##Example
node index.js 10 tbsp

Output
Scaled recipe for 10 servings:

Flour: 53.33 tbsp
Milk: 40 tbsp
Eggs: 3.33 pcs
